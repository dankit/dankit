Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github profile! It has been awhile since I have touched this place. You can find some of my past projects to get a better sense of what inspired me to be a software developer. I love designing programs that are for serving the greater good, and I'm anticipating a new project soon (2023), so stay tuned! Hopefully you will be able to see how I've grown as a software dev, if not through the inspiration then atleast the code quality (lol)
