Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github profile! It has been awhile since I have touched this place. You can find some of my past projects here to get a better sense of what inspired me to be a software developer. I love designing programs that are for serving others and improving quality of life. I'm anticipating a new cloud based project soon (2023), so stay tuned! Hopefully soon you will be able to see how I've grown as a software dev, if not through the ideas and inspirations, then through the quality of code (lol)
